The application is developed using MERN stack

You can access the application from https://mern-stack-todo-app-frontend-tau.vercel.app/

The application has home page to display all the tasks with edit, delete, mark as completed btns.

Add task page responsible for adding a new task.

Update page responsible for update the task.

Home page also has options to filter tasks based on title and due date.

Application is responsive to different screen sizes.

Im working on integrating an authentication/ authorization part to the system so it can be used by different users and to secure application endpoints
